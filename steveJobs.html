<p>Steve Jobs was the co-founder and CEO of Apple Inc. He is widely considered to be a brilliant businessman, as well as
    one of the greatest tech visionaries of our time.</p>

<p>
    The story of his life is nothing short of fascinating. After dropping out of college, he started Apple with his
    friend <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Wozniak">Steve Wozniak</a> in 1976 at the age of 21. The duo
    gained wealth and fame a year later for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_II">Apple II</a>, on of the
    first successful mass-produced personal computers. This was followed by the very successful Macintosh in 1984, the
    first mass-produced computer with a GUI (Graphic User Interface). After being ousted from Apple in 1985, he went on
    to oversee the creation of two new companies: NeXT computer and <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pixar">Pixar.</a> With the success of the movie Toy Story, Steve became a
    billionaire.
</p>

<p>
    In 1997, Steve returned to Apple. Bill Gates and Microsoft dominated the computer industry, and Apple was on the
    brink of extinction. Nonetheless, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reality_distortion_field">Steve was a
    fantastic salesman,</a> and used his business acumen to slowly bring the company back to profitability
